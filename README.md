# 🎨 DreamForge - Your Personal AI Art Workshop

Welcome to **DreamForge**, an open-source AI image generation platform. This tool allows you to create images based on your project descriptions. You can easily deploy a powerful text-to-image tool on your local machine or server.

![Example Image](https://placehold.co/800x400/1e293b/ffffff?text=DreamForge%20UI)

## ✨ Core Features (v0.1)

- **Text-to-Image:** Input text descriptions to generate images.
- **API First:** All functionalities are accessible through a RESTful API.
- **One-Click Docker Deployment:** Use Docker Compose to start the entire application with a single command.
- **User-Friendly Frontend:** A simple web interface for easy operation.

## 📁 Project Structure

├── backend/
│   ├── main.py           # FastAPI backend service

## 🚀 How to Run

We strongly recommend running the project using Docker, as it is the simplest and fastest way to get started.

### Using Docker (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:** You must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

1. **Clone or Download the Project Files:** Ensure the `backend` directory, `frontend` directory, and `docker-compose.yml` file are in the same root directory.

2. **Start the Service:** Open your terminal in the project root directory (where `docker-compose.yml` is located) and run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. **Start Using:**
   - **Frontend Interface:** Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:80`.

To access the latest releases, visit our [Releases section](https://github.com/Krishna04-06/DreamForge/releases). Here, you can find downloadable files and instructions on how to execute them.

## 📚 Documentation

### Backend

The backend is built using FastAPI, which provides a robust framework for building APIs. The main entry point is located in `main.py`. This file contains the core logic for processing requests and generating images based on text input.

#### Requirements

The `requirements.txt` file lists all necessary Python packages. Make sure to install these dependencies if you choose to run the backend separately.

### Frontend

The frontend is designed to be simple and intuitive. The `index.html` file serves as the main interface. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a seamless user experience.

#### How It Works

1. **User Input:** Users enter a text description in the provided input field.
2. **API Call:** The frontend sends this description to the backend API.
3. **Image Generation:** The backend processes the request and generates an image.
4. **Display:** The generated image is then displayed in the frontend interface.

## 🔧 Configuration

You can customize the application by modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file. This file allows you to set environment variables, change ports, and configure other settings.

### Example Configuration

Here’s a basic example of what you might include in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/app
    environment:
      - ENV=development

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/app
```

## 🔍 Testing

Testing is crucial to ensure the application works as intended. You can run tests using the following command in the backend directory:

```bash
pytest
```

Make sure to install the testing dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider the following steps:

1. **Check Docker Installation:** Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed correctly.
2. **Review Logs:** Use the command `docker-compose logs` to check for errors.
3. **Validate Configuration:** Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` file is set up correctly.
